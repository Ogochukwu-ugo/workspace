# A Simple Todo App

This is a simple to-do list app built with react js. 
The app allows the user to add, and delete tasks, and also updates task states using toggle buttons.
When creating this app, I included local storage so that the user could see the list of tasks that had been added as well as the remaining tasks after a task had been deleted.
